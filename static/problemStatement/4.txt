Write a program to implement a singly linked list.

<h3>Input Format</h3>
<pre>
	The first line of input specifies the number of operations, q.
	The list is assumed to be empty initially.
	Operation formats:

	Inserts are of the form
	1 <position to insert element> <element to be inserted>

	Deletions are of the form
	2 <element at position to be deleted>

	Display
	3

	Exit
	4
</pre>

<h3>Output Format</h3>
<pre>
	No output is expected for an insert or exit.
	After a delete, the deleted element is to be displayed on a single line.
	A display operation must display the list as space seperated integers starting from the head.
</pre>

<h3>Example Input</h3>
<pre>
	7
	1 0 10
	1 1 20
	3
	2 0
	1 0 30
	3
	4
</pre>

<h3>Example Output</h3>
<pre>
	10 20
