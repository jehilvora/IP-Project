<p>
Chef has a sequence A containing N integers A1, A2, ..., AN.<br>

Chef is playing a game with this sequence. In this game, he may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): Choose an arbitrary pair of elements from the sequence such that their sum is even, delete these two elements from the sequence and insert their sum into the sequence instead.<br>

The goal of the game is to minimise the number of elements in the sequence.<br>

Help Chef to play the game and find the minimum possible size of the sequence at the end of the game!<br>
